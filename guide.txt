The order in which you should approach these programming and bioinformatics topics depends on your current level of
knowledge and your goals. However, a general progression that makes sense is as follows:

Python Village: Since you mentioned you're new to programming, it's a good idea to start with the Python Village. This
will help you learn the basics of the Python programming language, which will be essential for tackling more complex
problems later on.

Algorithmic Heights: After you have a grasp of Python fundamentals, you can move on to the Algorithmic Heights
exercises. These exercises focus on introductory algorithms and will provide you with a solid foundation in algorithmic
thinking.

Bioinformatics Stronghold: Once you are comfortable with algorithms and have a basic understanding of Python, you can
dive into the Bioinformatics Stronghold challenges. These problems cover a wide range of bioinformatics topics and will
help you understand the underlying concepts and algorithms used in bioinformatics analysis.

Bioinformatics Armory: After working on the Stronghold challenges, you can explore the Bioinformatics Armory. This
section will introduce you to existing tools and software used in bioinformatics analysis. It's a practical way to learn
how to apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios.

Bioinformatics Textbook Track: If you're looking to dive deeper into bioinformatics algorithms, the Textbook Track is a
great resource. It's based on a specific textbook and provides exercises that complement the content of the book. You
can tackle this track after gaining experience with the previous sections.

Remember that learning is a continuous process, and it's okay to revisit topics and exercises as needed. Additionally,
feel free to adapt this order based on your own learning style and preferences. It's important to focus on understanding
the concepts rather than rushing through the material.
