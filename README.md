## About Rosalind.info üß¨
---
Rosalind is an interactive platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving. It offers a vast collection of problems that can be solved using programming and bioinformatics skills. The problems are organized into problem sets at different levels of difficulty, each with a problem description, a dataset, and an explanation of the expected output. Users can solve the problems directly on the website by submitting their code, which is then run on the server and the output is displayed on the website. Alternatively, users can download the problem datasets and solve the problems offline. The solutions can be submitted to the website for verification. Additionally, the website provides a forum for users to discuss the problems and their solutions, making it an excellent resource for learning and collaboration.

## About me üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
---
I am a software developer, interested in getting to know more about bioinformatics and computational biology. I am using this platform to learn more about these fields and to improve both my programming skills and my knowledge of biology. I am using Python to solve the problems.
